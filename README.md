Accessible Vehicle Detection

This project, developed by our team at Southern Methodist University's Hackathon, achieved first place in the ParkHub track! We built an algorithm using computer vision to detect accessible vehicles in video streams by identifying the International Symbol of Access.

Problem Statement:

Create an algorithm that uses computer vision to detect if an
accessible vehicle is present in a video stream by looking for the
International Symbol of Access in places such as license plates
and windows. Criteria - Please do not attempt to detect people or
infer information about them present in images. - Use open
datasets. - Execute quickly enough to process a 30fps video
stream without dropping frames. - Outputs should be the bounding
boxes of any accessible vehicles and their confidence scores.
Judging - Speed: under 33ms, the lower the better. - Memory: the
lower the better. - Accuracy: detect an accessible vehicle in a
frame from an arbitrary video stream.
